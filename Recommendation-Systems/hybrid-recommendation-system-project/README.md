# Project Title

This project is configured for developing applications that require a graphical user interface (GUI) with PyQt5 along with data analysis and machine learning functionalities. It leverages popular libraries including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. The project also integrates the Surprise library for building recommender systems.

## Project Overview

This repository provides a ready-to-use Python environment tailored for applications that involve both GUI development (with PyQt5) and data-centric tasks including machine learning and data visualization. The setup ensures that all necessary libraries are installed with compatible versions.

## Environment Preparation

To ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly, follow one of the methods below to set up your environment.

### Using Python Virtual Environment (venv)

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
3. **Upgrade pip and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Using Conda

1. **Create a Conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create --name myenv python=3.10
   ```
2. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate myenv
   ```
3. **Install packages:**
   ```bash
   conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   conda install -c conda-forge pyqt
   pip install scikit-surprise fastapi uvicorn pydantic requests
   ```

## Dependencies

The primary dependencies for this project are:
- **PyQt5:** For building graphical user interfaces.
- **scikit-surprise:** A library for building and analyzing recommender systems.
- **numpy:** For numerical computing.
- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms.
- **matplotlib & seaborn:** For creating data visualizations.
- **FastAPI:** For building high-performance web APIs.
- **Uvicorn:** ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **Pydantic:** For data validation and settings management.
- **Requests:** For making HTTP requests.

## Usage

After setting up your environment, you can run your main application script. For example:
```bash
python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the entry point of your project.
